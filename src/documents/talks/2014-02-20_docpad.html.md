Combining SSG with a version control system like git and the advantages of pull requests gives you a modern alternative to heavy content management systems that need a server side application and database to serve dynamic content.

To write less code and keep it DRY, you can use CSS preprocessors and template engines. But people wanting to contribute also want to see their changes and this requires an environment setup (e.g.: for Jekyll - the most popular SSG - they would need to install ruby and the gem dependencies on their computer), which could be an obstacle.

Furthermore many people are not familiar with pull requests and donâ€™t dare using them or even don't have a GitHub account.

By using [DocPad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad) (a SSG for Node.js), moving some logic from the server to the browser and automating the pull request workflow, I will show you how to solve these problems.
